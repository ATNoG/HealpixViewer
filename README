Healpix Viewer is a software for visualization of Healpix maps stored in FITS files relying on the data processing methods of the Healpix package. This software is written in C++, uses OpenGL for map visualization, and Qt library for the GUI, allowing cross-platform portability.

Please consider this software as alfa. It mostly works but there are still a few bugs lying around and many other features are waiting to be added.

== Features ==

 - Support for high resolution sky maps in HEALPix format (until nside 4096)
 - Multiple viewports with synchronization between them
 - Mollweide and 3D sphere map projection
 - Rotate and zoom maps when using 3D sphere projection
 - Histogram and color map selector to control the colors used to display the sky maps
 - Support for polarization vectors over the map
 - Automatic resolution to balance between sky map detail and performance


== Requirements ==

To run HealpixViewer the following packages are necessary:
 - libQGlViewer - For rendering the visualization of Healpix maps - http://www.libqglviewer.com/
 - Healpix - For the manipulation of Healpix data - http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml
 - CFITSIO - For importing FITS files -  http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
 - Qt 4.x - For rendering of the UI - http://qt.nokia.com/products/


== Install Instructions ==

Make sure you have all the requirements needed and then run:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install (optional)

If in OSX you can also do:
  make app

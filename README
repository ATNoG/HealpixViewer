 - Support for high resolution sky maps in HEALPix format (until nside 4096)
 - Multiple viewports with synchronization between them
 - Mollweide and 3D sphere map projection
 - Rotate and zoom maps when using 3D sphere projection
 - Histogram and color map selector to control the colors used to display the sky maps
 - Support for polarization vectors over the map
 - Automatic resolution to balance between sky map detail and performance
